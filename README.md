# Instructions

1. Add script next-scene-hotkey.lua to obs studio from Tools -> Scripts.Enable loop scenes option.
2. Go to settings -> hot keys, and set hotkey for next scene to be F8 and for previous scene F7
3. Run the script mapLogitechToFunctionKeys to map logitech signals to F7/F8 (see below) 

## Caveats:

* The script mapLogitechToFunctionKeys resets on reboot
* Also, there is no easy way to restore the default behavior of logitech remote after running the script, other than rebooting
